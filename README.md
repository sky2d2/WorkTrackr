# WorkTrackr
*Team Task Management & Agile Progress Tracker*

---

## Project Overview

WorkTrackr is a lightweight, console-based productivity tool designed to help small teams manage tasks collaboratively.  
It enables users to create, assign, and track tasks, set priorities and deadlines, and monitor project progress through an Agile workflow â€” all within a simple, fast console application.

---

## Business Problem

Small teams often lack affordable, easy-to-use task management systems. Many existing tools are either too complex or too expensive.  
WorkTrackr addresses this by providing a streamlined Agile task management experience in a **simple C# console application**, with clear features focused on real team needs.

## Current Features (In Progress âœ…)

- Console-based **Main Menu** with core task management actions
- Create and manage tasks (title, description, priority, due date, status)
- Assign tasks to users
- Track task status:
  - Backlog â†’ In Progress â†’ In Review â†’ Completed
- View project progress through a basic dashboard
- Maintain team member list (users)
- **.gitignore** added to ensure clean repo

---

## Planned Features (Next Steps ðŸš€)

- Edit and delete tasks
- Add comments to tasks
- Enhanced dashboard with LINQ-based statistics
- Input validation and error handling
- Save/load data (optional, time permitting)

---

## Objectives

- Provide an easy-to-use task management system for small teams
- Implement Agile workflow concepts in a console application
